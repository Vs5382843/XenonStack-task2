The file for the sysopctl script should be named sysopctl.sh when uploading to GitHub. This follows common naming conventions for Bash scripts, making it clear that it is a shell script.

Once uploaded, you can include instructions in your README.md to rename it or make it executable after cloning, if necessary.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
chmod +x sysopctl.sh
sudo mv sysopctl.sh /usr/local/bin/sysopctl
This will allow users to execute sysopctl directly from the terminal after setting it up.
